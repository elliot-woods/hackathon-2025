3.  **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**: Create a detailed profile of the ideal customer. Include demographics, psychographics, behaviors, and motivations.

4.  **Refined Idea Definition**: Take the initial idea and refine it into a more specific and compelling product or service description.

5.  **10 Potential Directions**: Brainstorm and list 10 different strategic directions or pivots the startup could take. These should be creative and diverse.

6.  **Competitive Landscape**: Identify key competitors, both direct and indirect. What are their strengths and weaknesses? What is your startup's unique selling proposition (USP)?

7.  **Potential Monetization Strategies**: List and explain at least 5 potential ways the startup could generate revenue.

8.  **Initial MVP Features**: Outline the core features needed for a Minimum Viable Product to test the main hypothesis.
